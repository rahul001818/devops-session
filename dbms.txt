=> What is DBMS?
Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users’ data while considering appropriate security measures. DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application.


=> Types of DBMS :-
-> Hierarchical database
-> Network database
-> Relational database
-> Object-Oriented database

1.> Hierarchical DBMS :-
In a Hierarchical database, model data is organized in a tree-like structure. Data is Stored Hierarchically (top down or bottom up) format. Data is represented using a parent-child relationship. In Hierarchical DBMS parent may have many children, but children have only one parent.

2.> Network database :-
The network database model allows each child to have multiple parents. It helps you to address the need to model more complex relationships like as the orders/parts many-to-many relationship. In this model, entities are organized in a graph which can be accessed through several paths.

3.> Relational database :-
Relational DBMS is the most widely used DBMS model because it is one of the easiest. This model is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. Relational model stored in fixed structures and manipulated using SQL.

4.> Object-Oriented database :-
In Object-oriented Model data stored in the form of objects. The structure which is called classes which display data within it. It is one of the components of DBMS that defines a database as a collection of objects which stores both data members values and operations.


=> Advantages:-
- DBMS offers a variety of techniques to store & retrieve data.
- DBMS serves as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data.
- Offers Data Integrity and Security.
- A DBMS uses various powerful functions to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Reduced Application Development Time.


=> Disadvantages:-
- Cost of Hardware and Software of a DBMS is quite high which increases the budget of your organization.
- Use of the same program at a time by many users sometimes lead to the loss of some data.
- DBMS can’t perform sophisticated calculations
